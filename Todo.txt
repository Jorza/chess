	- Currently checks every valid move if the King would be in check after the move.
	- Can later make it so that it only checks whether the king is in check after a move if the moving piece is pinned or the king is already in check.
		Other moves can not result in the king being left in check.
	- Can later make it so that a pinned piece will not look for moves along paths that are guaranteed to leave the king in check.
		On each path, probe only one space. If it leaves the King in check, do not explore the path further.
		Only applies for pinned pieces.
